# QMIXRNN
Referring to pymarl, qmix is implemented with RNN to cope with SMAC environment

## Run
`python main.py --map-name=3s5z`

## TODO
Now this code can deal with some easy scenarios like 2s3z, 3s5z, 3m, 8m, and I'm trying to approach the result of pymarl. At the same time, I'm also trying to achieve some tricks on this code like multi step TD target and so on.
